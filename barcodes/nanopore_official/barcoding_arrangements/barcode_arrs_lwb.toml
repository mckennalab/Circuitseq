#     BCXX_1st                           BCXX_2nd
#
#  leads to basecall BCXX_2nd_FWD----------BCXX_1st_REV
#
#  the sequences BCXX_1st and BCXX_2nd will be equal
#  for most of their parts, especially for the main barcode.
#  They will usually only differ in the rear spacer between
#  barcode and (actual) strand.
